Tutorial on Typescript using the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to construct a front-end Pokedex.

Inspired by Ibrahima Ndaw's [article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-practical-guide-to-typescript-how-to-build-a-pokedex-app-using-html-css-and-typescript/) on freeCodeCamp titled "A Practical Guide to Typescript - How to Build a Pokedex App Using HTML, CSS, and Typescript."

The plan is to extend the project in two ways.
The first is to have a more detailed entry for each Pokemon, and the second is to implement a search bar for front-end users to search for a Pokemon based on name or National Pokedex index number.
